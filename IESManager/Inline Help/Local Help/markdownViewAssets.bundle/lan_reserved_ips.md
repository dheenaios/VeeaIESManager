# LAN / Reserved IPs

Individual devices on wireless APs or LAN ports can be assigned reserved IP addresses. You can add up to 10 reserved IP addresses on each LAN.

This screen is available only on the gateway VeeaHub. The setting is disabled if it is managed on the WAN, for example, if the LAN is bridged to the WAN, or if it is managed by an installed service such as vTPN.

To add a reserved IP tap the +Add Reserved IP button. The Add New Reserved IP dialog is displayed. After you have entered the details, tap Add to add the reserved IP address.

**When you have added one or more reserved IP addresses, you must restart the unit for the changes to take effect.**

The following configurations are offered on the new entry screen...

After adding the reservation, you are able to edit the entries from the Reserved IP list page. In addition to the above, you are able to "Clear Fields" and delete the entry by tapping "Remove". You will need to restart the unit to apply the changes.
