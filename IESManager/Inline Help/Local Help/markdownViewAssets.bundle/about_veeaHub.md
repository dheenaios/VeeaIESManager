# About VeeaHub

The first VeeaHub in a network has the status of gateway node (also called MEN), and connects the mesh to the Internet. Further VeeaHubs are edge nodes (also called MN).

The Node Name is set when the VeeaHub is added to your account. You can change it on this screen.
Position is an optional text field. You can use it for any descriptive purpose, for example, to show where the VeeaHub is located on your premises.

The following options are offered...

**Screen name**

The screen name also shows the node name and the serial number of the VeeaHub.

## Settings

**Node Name**
Tap on the row to customize the node name.

**Position**
This may be empty. The locale is free text that can be used to identify the VeeaHub, for example, by its location in a building.

**Node type**
MEN (Mesh Edge Node, gateway node) or MN (Mesh Node, network node). An MN connects to the wider internet via the MEN.

A MEN acts as a gateway for the mesh and has a number of connection options to the wider internet, including cellular, Ethernet and Wi-Fi backhaul. For a MEN, these options are configured by tapping on the WAN in the Dashboard.

If the node type is changed, the node must be rebooted. The mesh SSID automatically reverts to the default and can be changed to enable the VeeaHub to join the intended network.
