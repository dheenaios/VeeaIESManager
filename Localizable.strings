 Storyboard strings to be localised using the system localizable strings method
 To be done as needed as it is an automated process.
 
 - Select storyboard / file tab
 - Tap localisation
 - Create a base storyboard
 - Set the localisation method too... Localisable String file
 - Strings are linked back to the storyboard using the object id
